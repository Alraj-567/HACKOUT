Create a professional, vibrant, and interactive coastal hazard monitoring dashboard with the following requirements:

Project Description:
Coastal areas store vital blue carbon but face threats like storm surges, coastal erosion, pollution, and illegal activities. Build a comprehensive early warning and alerting platform that:

Collects data from physical sensors (tide gauges, weather stations), satellite feeds, and historical records.

Uses AI/ML (Python, TensorFlow, PyTorch) to analyze trends and detect anomalies such as rising sea levels, algal blooms, illegal dumping, or cyclonic activity.

Disseminates actionable alerts via SMS, mobile notifications, and web dashboards.

Target Users: Disaster management departments, coastal city governments, environmental NGOs, fisherfolk, and civil defence teams.

Impact:

Protect human lives and reduce economic losses by enabling timely interventions.

Preserve essential blue carbon habitats.

Support sustainable coastal management and community resilience.

Technical Requirements:

Data ingestion pipelines for real-time and historical data.

AI/ML models to predict anomalies.

Interactive web dashboards using React + D3.js.

Push/SMS notifications for alerts.

Map component showing hazard hotspots, with hoverable tooltips and real-time updates.

Design and Feature Requirements:

Vibrant and professional UI (less cartoonish, more sleek, modern design).

Include multiple tabs for better organization, for example:

Dashboard: Overview of all hazards and trends

Map: Hazard locations with hotspot markers

Alerts: Active alerts, history, and notifications

Analytics: Graphs and charts showing trends, predictions, and AI insights

Keep the “Made by TLE FIGHTERS” text on the bottom right corner intact.

Add hoverable tooltips, animated alert notifications, and color-coded hazard severity.

Bonus Features:

Filtering options by hazard type, severity, or date.

Search functionality for specific coastal areas.

Interactive charts with zoom/pan capability.

Deliverables:

Full working React web app with tabs, map, and dashboard.

Sample data simulation for sensors and satellite feeds.

Integration with AI/ML model for anomaly detection (can be mocked if actual model is not ready).
